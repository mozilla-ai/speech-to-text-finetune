This blueprint enables you to create your own [Speech-to-Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) / Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset, or use the [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) dataset, to finetune an ASR model to improve performance for your specific language & use-case. All of this can be done locally (even on your laptop!) ensuring no data leaves your machine, safeguarding your privacy. Using Common Voice as a backbone enables this blueprint to support an impressively wide variety of languages! More the exact list of languages supported please visit the Common Voice [website](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/languages).

### Built with
- Python 3.10+
- [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)

## Quick-start

**_Note_**: All scripts should be executed from the root directory of the repository.

This blueprint consists of three independent, yet complementary, components:

1. **Transcription app**: A simple UI that lets you record your voice, pick any HF ASR model, and get an instant transcription.
2. **Dataset maker app**: Another UI app that enables you to easily and quickly create your own Speech-to-Text dataset.
3. **Finetuning script**: A script to finetune your own STT model, either using Common Voice data or your own local data created by the Dataset maker app.

### Suggested flow for this repository

1. Use a virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -e .` & [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) e.g. for Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`, for Mac: `brew install ffmpeg`
2. Try existing transcription HF models on your own language & voice locally: `python demo/transcribe_app.py`
3. If you are not happy with the results, you can finetune a model with data of your language from Common Voice
   1. Configure `config.yaml` with the model, Common Voice dataset id from HF and hyperparameters of your choice.
   2. Finetune a model: `python src/speech_to_text_finetune/finetune_whisper.py`
4. Try again the transcription app with your newly finetuned model.
5. If the results are still not satisfactory, create your own Speech-to-Text dataset and model.
   1. Create a dataset: `python demo/make_local_dataset_app.py`
   2. Configure `config.yaml` with the model, local data directory and hyperparameters of your choice.
   3. Finetune a model: `python src/speech_to_text_finetune/finetune_whisper.py`
6. Finally try again the transcription app with the new model finetuned specifically for your own voice!
